                <p class="about">✦ Our shop was born from a passion for art toys, which began as a small collector who loved the design and creativity of these art toys, be it their unique designs, storytelling, or even the special feeling of owning a rare piece. What began as a hobby of collecting for personal enjoyment has inspired us to open this small shop to share that joy with others who share our passion for art toys. We believe that every character has a story, and each piece has its own value, whether you're a beginner or a seasoned collector. Therefore, this place is more than just an art toy shop, but "a place for those who understand and are passionate about toys that are more than just toys." We carefully select works from both local and international artists to allow everyone to fully experience the world of art toys.</p>
